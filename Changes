        - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY WARNING:

          Due to the rework of the lastmail counter file, the old format will
          cause errors in the new system. In order to port to the new format,
          take the number currently stored and replace the zeroes in the
          following string with it: daily=0,weekly=0,reports=0. Then save the
          file.
